# Objective of Group Exercise:-

Apply data preprocessing techniques learned in Chapter 2 to a real-world dataset . 
The goal is to understand how raw data is prepared before applying machine learning models.

# DATASET REQUIREMENTS
# 1️. select one real dataset from sources such as:
Kaggle
UCI Machine Learning Repository
Open government data portals

# 2. The dataset must:
Contain numerical and/or categorical features
Include missing values ​​and/or potential outliers
Have at least 100 records

# TASKS
# 1️. Handling Missing Values
Identify missing values
Apply appropriate imputation methods (mean, median, mode, or justified alternative)

# 2️. Scaling Numerical Features
Apply Z-score standardization
Apply Min-Max normalization
Briefly explain the difference

# 3️. Handling Noise
Choose one numerical feature
Inject artificial noise
Apply a smoothing technique (eg rolling mean)
Show before vs after results

# 4️. Handling Outliers
Detect outliers using Z-score
Handle them via removal or transformation
Justify your approach

# 5️. Feature Selection
Apply at least one of the following:
Filter method (eg correlation, mutual information)
Wrapper method (e.g. RFE)
Embedded method (e.g. Lasso)
Explain why this method was chosen.
